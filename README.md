# Graffathon 2016
My entry "Paljon Toruja" in http://www.graffathon.fi/2016/ Oldschool compo

##Instructions for compiling
Java 8 and Maven 3 are required (or IDE integration for maven, I used eclipse)

Install Moonlander to local maven repo first before trying to build this (run 'mvn install')

Run 'mvn package'

See zips under target folder


Note that at least for now the code is as-is from the compo entry, so it's a "bit" messy. I will try to extract a starter kit or examples for using Processing with Java with maven being the project/build tool.
